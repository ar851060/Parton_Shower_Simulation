## Parton_Shower_Simulation
I complete this project in Technion in 2018, advised by Prof. Enrique.

This project is a model which simulating Parton Shower Scattering after proton-proton colliding in ATLAS.

First model is Test_5.py.

This model is based on "Monte Carlo and Jet Tutorial" by "Samuel Meehan".

It simulates Parton Shower after colliding.

Second model is project_1.py.

This model is based on "PYTHIA manual" by "Torbjorn Sjostrand".

It simulates jet mass, z factor, and scattering angle what we could see in ATLAS workstation.

zmake function is to make the range of z.

veto function is doing Veto Algorithm.

checking function is to check whether all variables are in constrains.

alpha function is to create alpha constant.
