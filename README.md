# Parton_Shower_Simulation
I complete this project in Technion, advised by Prof. Enrique.
This project is a model which simulating Parton Shower Scattering after proton-proton colliding in ATLAS.

First model is Test_5.py.
This model is based on "Monte Carlo and Jet Tutorial" by "Samuel Meehan".
It simulates Parton Shower after colliding.
Each point in the graph means a splitting event.

Second model is
